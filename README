AUTO2 - a best-first-search theorem prover implemented in Isabelle

Please see doc.pdf for documentation.

Current version of the program works with Isabelle2017.

Description of the examples:

- HOL/DataStrs: verification of functional programs. Include material
  on lists, trees, priority queue, Dijkstra's algorithm, and rectangle
  intersection.

- HOL/SepLogic: verification of imperative programs using separation
  logic. Foundation of separation logic follows "A Separation Logic
  Framework for Imperative HOL" in Isabelle AFP.

- HOL/Primes_Ex: elementary number theory of primes, up to the proof
  of infinitude of primes and the unique factorization
  theorem. Follows theories Primes and UniqueFactorization in
  HOL/Number_Theory.

- HOL/Hoare: development of Hoare logic. Follows chapters Imp, Equiv,
  Hoare, and Hoare2 in "Software Foundations".

- FOL: axiomatic set theory based on Isabelle/FOL. Sources:

  - Basic set theory and construction of natural numbers: Isabelle/ZF.

  - More set theory: "Theory of Sets" by Bourbaki chapter II and part
    of chapter III.

  - Basic group theory and construction of real numbers: corresponding
    examples in HOL.

  - Arrow impossibility theorem: following Arrow_Order in
    AFP/ArrowImpossibilityGS. The original theory is one of seven test
    cases in "Sledgehammer: Judgement Day".

  - Point-set topology and construction of the fundamental group:
    "Topology" by Munkres.
