AUTO2 - a best-first-search theorem prover based on Isabelle

Please see doc.pdf for documentation.

To see the examples:

Get development version of Isabelle. Follow directions in

http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/tip/README_REPOSITORY

(this code does not work with Isabelle2014, due to recent changes to
the Isabelle library, although only a few modifications are needed to
make it work there).

Open Primes_Ex.thy in jEdit to see the program prove selected theorems
in elementary number theory (from HOL/Number_Theory/Primes.thy).
