AUTO2 - a best-first-search theorem prover implemented in Isabelle

Please see doc.pdf for documentation (it is slightly out of date -
refers to the third public version).

Current version of the program works with Isabelle2016-RC0.

Description of the examples:

- Primes_Ex: elementary number theory of primes, up to the proof of
  infinitude of primes and the unique factorization theorem. Follows
  theories Primes and UniqueFactorization in HOL/Number_Theory.

- Lists_Ex, RBT_Ex: lists, trees, and red-black trees. Some standard
  material on lists and trees follow Chapter 2 (Programming and
  Proving) of "Concrete Semantics". The material on red-black trees
  follows Section 8.4 of "Certified Programming with Dependent Types",
  and some of theory RBT_Impl in HOL/Library.

- Hoare_Exp, Hoare_States, Hoare_Equiv, Hoare_Rules: development of
  Hoare logic. Follows chapters Imp, Equiv, Hoare, and Hoare2 in
  "Software Foundations".

- Imp_Ex_Reverse, Imp_Ex_Quicksort, Imp_Ex_Linked_Lists,
  Imp_Ex_Binary_Trees: verification of imperative programs based on
  Imperative_HOL. The first three examples follow the corresponding
  example in HOL/Imperative_HOL/ex.

- Analysis: construction of real numbers using Cauchy sequences. Proof
  of completeness of real numbers in several forms. Partly follows
  theory Real in HOL/.
