AUTO2 - a best-first-search theorem prover implemented in Isabelle

Please see doc.pdf for documentation.

Current version of the program works with Isabelle2016-1.

Description of the examples:

- HOL/Primes_Ex: elementary number theory of primes, up to the proof
  of infinitude of primes and the unique factorization
  theorem. Follows theories Primes and UniqueFactorization in
  HOL/Number_Theory.

- HOL/DataStrs: lists, trees, and red-black trees. Some standard
  material on lists and trees follow Chapter 2 (Programming and
  Proving) of "Concrete Semantics". The material on red-black trees
  follows Section 8.4 of "Certified Programming with Dependent Types",
  and some of theory RBT_Impl in HOL/Library.

- HOL/Hoare: development of Hoare logic. Follows chapters Imp, Equiv,
  Hoare, and Hoare2 in "Software Foundations".

- HOL/SepLogic: separation logic. Foundation of separation logic and
  part of the linked list example follow "A Separation Logic Framework
  for Imperative HOL" in Isabelle AFP. Include many other examples in
  separation logic.

- FOL: axiomatic set theory based on Isabelle/FOL. Sources:

  - Basic set theory and construction of natural numbers: Isabelle/ZF.

  - More set theory: "Theory of Sets" by Bourbaki chapter II and part
    of chapter III.

  - Basic group theory and construction of real numbers: corresponding
    examples in HOL.

  - Arrow impossibility theorem: following Arrow_Order in
    AFP/ArrowImpossibilityGS. The original theory is one of seven test
    cases in "Sledgehammer: Judgement Day".

  - Point-set topology and construction of the fundamental group:
    "Topology" by Munkres.
