AUTO2 - a best-first-search theorem prover implemented in Isabelle

Please see doc.pdf for documentation.

Current version of the program works with Isabelle2016-1.

AUTO2, a saturation-based heuristic prover for higher-order logic
(ITP 2016): http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07577

Description of the examples:

- Primes_Ex: elementary number theory of primes, up to the proof of
  infinitude of primes and the unique factorization theorem. Follows
  theories Primes and UniqueFactorization in HOL/Number_Theory.

- DataStrs: lists, trees, and red-black trees. Some standard material
  on lists and trees follow Chapter 2 (Programming and Proving) of
  "Concrete Semantics". The material on red-black trees follows
  Section 8.4 of "Certified Programming with Dependent Types", and
  some of theory RBT_Impl in HOL/Library.

- Hoare: development of Hoare logic. Follows chapters Imp, Equiv,
  Hoare, and Hoare2 in "Software Foundations".

- Analysis: construction of real numbers using Cauchy sequences. Proof
  of completeness of real numbers in several forms. Partly follows
  theory Real in HOL/.

- Arrow_Ex: Arrow's impossibility theorem, following Arrow_Order in
  AFP/ArrowImpossibilityGS. The original theory is one of seven test
  cases in "Sledgehammer: Judgement Day".

- Algebra_Ex: basic group theory. Follows theories Group and Coset in
  HOL/Algebra.

- SepLogic: separation logic. Foundation of separation logic and part
  of the linked list example follow "A Separation Logic Framework for
  Imperative HOL" in Isabelle AFP. Include many other examples in
  separation logic.

- FOL: axiomatic set theory based on Isabelle/FOL. Sources:

  - Basic set theory and construction of natural numbers: Isabelle/ZF.

  - More set theory: "Theory of Sets" by Bourbaki chapter II and part
    of chapter III.

  - Basic group theory and construction of real numbers: corresponding
    examples in HOL.

  - Point-set topology and construction of the fundamental group:
    "Topology" by Munkres.
