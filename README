AUTO2 - a best-first-search theorem prover based on Isabelle

Please see doc.pdf for documentation.

Current version of the program works with Isabelle2015.

Description of the examples:

- Primes_Ex: elementary number theory of primes, up to the proof of
  infinitude of primes and the unique factorization theorem. Follows
  theories Primes and UniqueFactorization in HOL/Number_Theory.

- Lists_Ex, RBT_Ex: lists, trees, and red-black trees. Some standard
  material on lists and trees follow Chapter 2 (Programming and
  Proving) of "Concrete Semantics". The material on red-black trees
  follows Section 8.4 of "Certified Programming with Dependent Types",
  and some of theory RBT_Impl in HOL/Library.

- Hoare_Exp, Hoare_States, Hoare_Equiv, Hoare_Rules: development of
  Hoare logic. Follows chapters Imp, Equiv, Hoare, and Hoare2 in
  "Software Foundations".
